        <h2>Instructions: Birria beef</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add olive oil. 
                When hot, season beef with salt and pepper and add to pot. Sear on all sides. 
                Add half of the onion to the pot and cook for two minutes more. 
                Remove the dutch oven from heat and set aside while you make the sauce.</li>
            <li>Remove the stems and seeds from the dried chile peppers.</li>
            <li>In a medium pot, add the chiles, tomatoes, half onion, garlic cloves, 
                cinnamon stick, and bay leaf. Pour in enough water to cover all ingredients, 
                about 4 to 5 cups. Place on stove over medium-high heat and bring to boil. 
                Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Add remaining seasonings to the saucepot: dried oregano, cumin seeds, 
                dried thyme, and salt and peppercorns. Give it a stir and simmer for 
                10 minutes more. Remove from heat and allow to cool for a couple of minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the contents of the saucepot into a large wire-mesh strainer over 
                a large bowl. Remove the bay leaf and cinnamon stick and discard. 
                Place remaining solids into a blender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 2 cups of the broth from the sauce into the blender, plus 1 cup of 
                beef broth. Whirl until well blended. Taste and add more salt if needed 
                and blend just until mixed in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pot with the beef and onion back on the stove at medium heat. 
                Pour the contents of the blender over the beef. If the sauce is not enough 
                liquid to cover the beef, pour in enough beef broth to cover. 
                Bring to a simmer, then cover and lower the heat. Simmer until meat is 
                tender and shreds easily about 2Â½ to 3 hours.
            </li>
        </ol>
